# Mahjong Platforms

This article showcases online platforms where it is possible to play some variant of Mahjong, both open source and closed / for-profit / private. The reason that we share non-OSS platforms is simply because these platforms are popular to play on and therefore draw interest from developers who then produce open-source projects based on those platforms.

Said projects that improve or customize closed platforms can be found throughout the rest of this repository.
